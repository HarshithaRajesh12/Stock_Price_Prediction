Prior research indicates that integrating sentiment from news articles and social media can improve predictive models, especially when combined with deep learning architectures like LSTM."

        "1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical closing prices and textual news data.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Scoring:** Apply NLP techniques to compute sentiment scores for each date.\n",
        "3. **Feature Merging:** Combine daily sentiment scores with price features.\n",
        "4. **Model Training:** Use an LSTM model with multivariate inputs (price + sentiment).\n",
        "5. **Evaluation:** Compare performance with price-only models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach stems from evidence in the literature that sentiment capture can add predictive power by modelling market psychology."

Future work will focus on integrating sentiment-based features with the LSTM model to build a more robust hybrid forecasting system."
